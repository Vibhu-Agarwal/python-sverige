            <h2>Become a sponsor of PyCon Sweden 2019!</h2>
            <p>
              The 6th PyCon Sweden will be a conference with 450
              attendees, all sharing the passion for Python
              programming language. We plan to have workshops and panel discussions
              during this year's 2-day event.
              The conference will be filled with world class speakers, both local and
              international, software engineers, system
              administrators, specialists, scientists, and other
              people who rely on the use of Python. The conference
              provides an unique setting to build connections between
              organizations and individuals in the Swedish Python
              scene.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a sponsor PyCon Sweden 2019 makes it possible to
              stand out as a Python community supporter, to attract
              talent, and to make themselves known among other
              organizations using Python.
            </p>
            <p>
              For us your support makes it possible for us to keep the
              participation fee low, enabling the conference to as
              many people as possible.

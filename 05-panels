              Develops are in high demand. According Svenska Dagbladet is Sweden in need of 70 000
              programmers until 2022. To bridge the gap between developers and corporate
              we invite talent seekers from different companies here in Stockholm. We will ask them
              to share their view about the talents they are missing to accelerate their development
              speed and what we as python developers can do, to make our CVs seen in the application
              process. After the panel you have the chance to meet them person during the job fair.

              How can we share our passion for programming to others and the next generation? Where is a good starting point
              to learn python and programming in general? After reaching some seniority in programming,
              what can I do to continue learning? And what are the keys to create a learning environment?
              During this panel we will find answers for those questions and discuss the role of education
              in programming. We are excited to welcome the passionate community builders and coding teachers
              as our guests:

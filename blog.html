                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Errol:</b> In my talk I will share some of the learnings on setting up and scaling an AI
                      function with a focus on the tech side. I will share how we create software that can go from a
                      few markets in early proof of concept into global industrialization with a short timeline.
                      I will share our architecture to accomplish this and highlight some of the success factors of
                      our work.

                       <b>Christine: You were working as a data scientist throughout your whole career, what is
                       it that fascinates you about data science? </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Errol:</b> Well most of my professional life I have worked as a data scientist. What
                       fascinates me is the insights we can derive from data and putting them into practical use.
                       Becoming more relevant in general and being able to take informed decisions with the help of data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: Which tips or tools would you recommend to data scientists to maximize their
                       insights? Where could they use python? </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Errol:</b> I am one of those that started out with excel… This was early in my career before
                       I studied computer engineering and learned about SQL, databases and Java before finding Python
                       5+ years ago. The main speedup in my work came when I started saving my functions and generalizing
                       them enough so that they could be reused as libraries. Spending a bit of time after each task to
                       catch my learnings have really helped me improving the time to insights and action compared to a
                       few years ago. Someone once told me that programming gives you superpowers and it is true. You
                       constantly find new ways to process your data and new libraries are being created every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: As the lead of data science at H&M you are working with big data, where do you see
                        challenges in setting up advanced analytics with AI all the way into production?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Errol:</b> The biggest challenge when working with large datasets is that you need to understand
                       the practical implications of not fitting data into memory on your laptop or local server. You are
                       entering the domain of distributed computing which adds an additional layer of complexity that will
                       impact your code. These challenges are a bit easier today to handle ,compared to a few years ago,
                       thanks to spark/pyspark. Other than that, the data science process is still the same. You are exploring
                       your data, modelling it and then predicting the future. The main challenge is to do this in an
                       efficient way. You need to write good code following best practices if you want to reach production
                       and stay there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: What was your favourite project/proof of concept that became real?
                       And what factors made it successful?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Errol:</b> Well we have one project here at H&M that we started in January that just started
                       delivering into production (September). The key success factors for that was that we started with
                       a strong team that focused on the end to end process with software engineering best practices.
                       So, creating an environment for data scientists to work with the exploratory part, feature
                       engineering and modelling and then having a fully automated pipeline for training and prediction.
                       The end result is really cool and I really enjoy watching the vision we created early in the
                        year now delivering value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: Where do you see data science in production develop in the future? </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Errol:</b> We need to work more on how we handle our models in production. One of the big
                       challenges right now is that we can create something that goes in production, but we are not
                       that good in following up on the results or when we do the feedback loop is usually too long.
                       This needs to improve for everything that goes into production. Things change and we need to
                       understand that change and act accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: Which topics would you like to explore more further on?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Errol:</b> I would personally like to spend more time on graphs and explore how we can be
                       better in using them. One of the topics I am really interested in but haven’t had the time to
                       explore fully is knowledge graphs. They are really interesting concepts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> Montreal is actually a fairly prominent tech hub in Canada.
                       There are many Python-related meetups in the city, which is wonderful -- and
                       some of them actually take place at Plotly HQ! It's great to be able to share
                       knowledge with fellow programmers face-to-face, instead of just over GitHub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: During Plotly’s workshop at PyCon Sweden 2019 we will learn
                       more about data visualization tools. What excites you about the applications
                       you are working with, Dash Bio and Dash DAQ?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> The way that human beings best communicate and interact with data,
                       in my opinion, is intuitive and based on our senses; we do not always immediately
                       understand sets of numbers on a screen, but we do have an innate understanding
                       of colours, shapes, and
                       sizes that has been developed over thousands of years. This is particularly relevant
                       in manufacturing processes and bioinformatics projects, both of which rely heavily
                       on understanding large volumes of often complex data.

                       <p>Being able to work on tools like Dash Bio and Dash DAQ means that I am playing a
                       (small) part in "translating" computer-readable information into human-interpretable
                        visualizations, and I personally find it incredibly exciting to see these projects
                        being used "in the wild" for many different applications.</p>

                       Where do you see the differences in developing programs for research projects
                       compared to software products?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> Research projects are generally far more specialized than software
                        products. I remember that as part of my undergraduate thesis project, I wrote quite
                        a bit of code that involved creating a simple neural network that was used to
                        differentiate between two very specific particle collision events which involved
                        either an electron or a photon. I can't imagine this being incredibly useful
                        anywhere outside of that particular field of research (unless it is, in which
                        case I would be very excited). As a consequence of that, the only people looking
                        at and using my code were researchers from the same lab -- people with incredible
                        levels of domain-specific knowledge who understood the "story" that my program
                        was telling, and who could come to me directly if they weren't sure about the
                        reasoning behind a particular design decision I made.

                        <p>
                            In contrast, software products need to be much more robust. Working on
                            open-source projects like Dash has opened my eyes to the many things that
                            need to be considered when developing software that is used by thousands of
                            people worldwide -- for example, modularity, readability, and writing good
                            tests. These things should be paramount when developing any software, whether
                            it's for personal use or public use; however, the bar is much higher (simply
                            because it needs to be) for software products that are created to serve a
                            more varied audience.

                       <b>Christine: What do you like about programming in python? Do you have a
                       favourite library?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> My favourite thing about Python is its accessibility; besides
                       being useful in and of itself, it has the additional benefit of serving as a
                       friendly introduction to the wide, wonderful world of software development.
                       It's a language that has almost a one-to-one mapping with the way that humans
                       reason through problems, and that makes it incredibly valuable as a medium for
                       teaching the core concepts of programming.

                       <p>I appreciate the power that other more lower-level languages have; I studied
                       physics and computer science, so I know that it's important to understand the
                       physical limitations of hardware and the contingencies that come hand-in-hand
                       with that. However, I also acknowledge that things like memory allocation and
                       efficient caching can be confusing for beginners to understand immediately.
                       </p>

                       <p>As for a favourite library, I don't think I could have gotten through my
                       degree without extensive use of numpy -- so I'll choose that!

                       <b>Shammamah:</b> So many things! I'm hoping that I'll be able to take an
                       "outer space vacation" at some point during my life. On a more grounded note,
                       I'm very interested in quantum computing; it's incredibly exciting to see a field
                       that has a wealth of knowledge and applications that is yet to be discovered.

                      <b>Tess:</b> I discussed a little with Anna (Anna Kazakova Lindegren, chairwoman of PyCon Sweden), and I have
                            a keynote prepared already about AI and ethics, but also have a session about my teams work with
                            video action detection (soccer highlights and other use cases) with deep learning, and video
                            processing using python libraries like keras and openCV. Anna said the second option was better
                            and that it was ok to keep it pretty technical as well (given the crowd) rather than only inspirational.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: Of the material and resources that you share online, which one would be a good first step
                                  towards machine learning?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Tess:</b> My two favourite starter resources for deep learning are Francois Chollets book
                             "Deep Learning with Python" and Andrew Ng's coursera deep learning specialization "deeplearning.ai".
                             When you're past starter, I think a good way to really understand deep learning, is to review and
                             try to implement papers. On our
                             YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXvHuBMbgJw67i5vrMBBobA">
                                                "Machine Learning at Microsoft"</a>
                             we do a weekly paper
                             review, where we discuss the ins and outs of many important ML papers
                              - on this channel we also talk about many of
                             the projects we work on.
                             I can add

                    <p>
                       <b>Tess:</b>  Apart from the obvious, numpy and pandas, I frequently use keras + tensorflow for deep
                                     learning, and opencv for video/image pre-processing. I also like retinanet for object
                                     detection. I also frequently use a library some of the guys on my team created, mPyPl,
                                     a functional library (with pipes) for speedy processing of large amounts of videos and images.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Tess:</b>  I am an engineer at heart, was an .net dev for a long time before starting with python and
                                     machine learning. As an engineer, I am allergic to any project where we gratuitously use
                                     machine learning. As in use it because it is "cool", even though there are other better
                                     ways to solve the problem. I'm excited about projects where we solve real business needs
                                     in the best way possible. In my keynote [assuming I do the 2nd one] I will talk about
                                     how we combine engineering and deep learning.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Tess:</b>   Interesting question, and one that I am personally thinking about a lot. While
                                      I didn't really become a better soccer player, we spent a lot of prep on understanding
                                      what makes an interesting play in soccer, as the goal of the algos was to determine
                                      "interesting passages" in the soccer match. In general, machine learning algorithms
                                      think very differently than humans, which also makes them quite hard to interpret.
                                      This is also something I touch on in my session, and depending on how interpretable
                                      you need your models to be you may need to make different choices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: Where do you see current challenges for machine learning and artificial intelligence
                                         in production?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Tess:</b>   The question of interpretability is a major one. If we don't know how the model makes its
                                      predictions, it may make very bad decisions, such as acting racist, or sexist or otherwise
                                      non-inclusive, or really plain wrong. On the other hand, if we know exactly how we make these
                                      decisions, we can implement it as a rules based system. We need to be somewhere in between,
                                      but being able to trust the system is one big challenge. A second, related challenge is that
                                      models can often be very fragile. They may work perfectly for exactly one set of data, but if
                                      you just change a few words in a text, or the lighting of an image, it may fail completely.
                                      Making the model more robust is a hard challenge, and sometimes also a security problem.
                    </p>

                       <b>Christine: What subjects do you want to look into more in the future? </b>

                    <p>
                       <b>Tess:</b>   The subjects of interpretability, robustness and ethics are some of the areas I find most
                                      interesting, and the mix between traditional engineering and machine learning. Technically,
                                      I love anything vision (video, images etc.), but another area I spend a lot of time on during
                                      our projects is proper engineering practices, and dev ops for machine learning, so that it actually
                                      has a chance of making it into production.

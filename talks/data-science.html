            Production ready machine learning pipelines in H&M <br>By <i>Misbah Uddin</i></a>

      <p>To enable data-driven decision making, H&M is betting big on machine
        learning algorithms. As these algorithms proven extremely successful,
        our use cases needed to scale rapidly from few countries to almost every
        country where H&M operates. With that, we needed to rethink how we
        orchestrate machine learning pipelines to train and serve a large
        number of new models in production on a regular basis.

        In this talk, we share how we designed,  implemented, and operationalized
        a cloud-native scalable architecture for machine learning algorithms using

        Imbalanced classes is surprisingly common problem in machine learning.
        However, many machine learning algorithms do not work very well with it
        and can give wrong sense of good performance because of high accuracy score.
        we will get familiar with class imbalance and then see various techniques
        to handle imbalanced classes.

		<h2>I want you to write less Python code</h2>
		<p>
			Serverless allows us to build and run applications without thinking about servers.
			Additional benefits are that the cloud provider can take care of tasks we usually do with code,
			like error handling and retries. Let's look at how serverless can reduce the Python code we
			write and focus on the pure business logic.

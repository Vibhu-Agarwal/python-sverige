									How do you implement an application that can pick out the interesting parts of a soccer game? What do you do when you don't have enough data, or when the data is too specific? How do you know that you are actually solving the problem, or even the right problem?
									<br><br>
									Writing a neural network in Python using Keras is very straight forward, you can do it in 20 lines or less, but is that all there is? Welcome to a journey through some real world problems and the thinking when working through them.

									As we progress further into the Information Age, the number of factors involved in making important business decisions increases exponentially. We will discuss the benefits of operationalizing Python models to better inform the increasingly complicated choices that need to be made in an increasingly complicated world, as well as highlight examples that showcase the ubiquity of this approach.

                      Today our keynote
                      Shammamah Hossain, a McGill University alumnus with a joint
                      degree in physics and computer science and software engineer at
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://plot.ly/">Plotly</a> tells us about the
                      python community in Montreal, her experiences of working in research compared
                      with software development and what we will learn about Plotly's products
                      during the workshop at the <b>6th PyCon Sweden</b> at Münchenbryggeriet
                      in the center of Stockholm..

                      <b>Christine: Can you give some hints about the topic of your talk?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Shammamah:</b> I'm very excited and honoured to be speaking at this year's
                      PyCon! I know that the audience comprises people from all walks of life and
                      many different industries, so I'll be talking about the importance of analytics
                      and visualization workflows across all of those worlds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: How is the Python community in Montreal?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> Montreal is actually a fairly prominent tech hub in Canada.
                       There are many Python-related meetups in the city, which is wonderful -- and
                       some of them actually take place at Plotly HQ! It's great to be able to share
                       knowledge with fellow programmers face-to-face, instead of just over GitHub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: During Plotly’s workshop at PyCon Sweden 2019 we will learn
                       more about data visualization tools. What excites you about the applications
                       you are working with, Dash Bio and Dash DAQ?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> The way that human beings best communicate and interact with data,
                       in my opinion, is intuitive and based on our senses; we do not always immediately
                       understand sets of numbers on a screen, but we do have an innate understanding
                       of colours, shapes, and
                       sizes that has been developed over thousands of years. This is particularly relevant
                       in manufacturing processes and bioinformatics projects, both of which rely heavily
                       on understanding large volumes of often complex data.

                       <p>Being able to work on tools like Dash Bio and Dash DAQ means that I am playing a
                       (small) part in "translating" computer-readable information into human-interpretable
                        visualizations, and I personally find it incredibly exciting to see these projects
                        being used "in the wild" for many different applications.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: You were working as a research assistant before starting at Plotly.
                       Where do you see the differences in developing programs for research projects
                       compared to software products?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> Research projects are generally far more specialized than software
                        products. I remember that as part of my undergraduate thesis project, I wrote quite
                        a bit of code that involved creating a simple neural network that was used to
                        differentiate between two very specific particle collision events which involved
                        either an electron or a photon. I can't imagine this being incredibly useful
                        anywhere outside of that particular field of research (unless it is, in which
                        case I would be very excited). As a consequence of that, the only people looking
                        at and using my code were researchers from the same lab -- people with incredible
                        levels of domain-specific knowledge who understood the "story" that my program
                        was telling, and who could come to me directly if they weren't sure about the
                        reasoning behind a particular design decision I made.

                        <p>
                            In contrast, software products need to be much more robust. Working on
                            open-source projects like Dash has opened my eyes to the many things that
                            need to be considered when developing software that is used by thousands of
                            people worldwide -- for example, modularity, readability, and writing good
                            tests. These things should be paramount when developing any software, whether
                            it's for personal use or public use; however, the bar is much higher (simply
                            because it needs to be) for software products that are created to serve a
                            more varied audience.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: What do you like about programming in python? Do you have a
                       favourite library?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> My favourite thing about Python is its accessibility; besides
                       being useful in and of itself, it has the additional benefit of serving as a
                       friendly introduction to the wide, wonderful world of software development.
                       It's a language that has almost a one-to-one mapping with the way that humans
                       reason through problems, and that makes it incredibly valuable as a medium for
                       teaching the core concepts of programming.

                       <p>I appreciate the power that other more lower-level languages have; I studied
                       physics and computer science, so I know that it's important to understand the
                       physical limitations of hardware and the contingencies that come hand-in-hand
                       with that. However, I also acknowledge that things like memory allocation and
                       efficient caching can be confusing for beginners to understand immediately.
                       </p>

                       <p>As for a favourite library, I don't think I could have gotten through my
                       degree without extensive use of numpy -- so I'll choose that!
                       </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Christine: What would you like to explore in the future?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <b>Shammamah:</b> So many things! I'm hoping that I'll be able to take an
                       "outer space vacation" at some point during my life. On a more grounded note,
                       I'm very interested in quantum computing; it's incredibly exciting to see a field
                       that has a wealth of knowledge and applications that is yet to be discovered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We are excited to have Shammamah coming all the way from Montreal to PyCon Sweden,
